I am Lokeshwaran manoharan, a Bioinformatician by training and currenly working as one at [NBIS](https://nbis.se/). I amenthusiastic about computational tools and techniques to answer different biological questions. I have mainly worked with microbiology projects in terms of their ecology and evolution and they always fascinate me.  

#### EDUCATION
    • PhD in biology from Dec-2011 to Apr-2016 at Lund University, Lund, Sweden.
        Dissertation title: Diversity of soil microbial communities in the perspective of targeting functional genes.
      
    • M.S in bioinformatics and systems biology from 2009 to 2011 at Chalmers University of
      Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.
    
    • B.Tech in industrial biotechnology from 2004 to 2008 at Anna University, Chennai, India.

#### WORK EXPERIENCE
    • Research assistant from Aug-2016 to Feb-2016 at Lund University, Lund, Sweden. I worked in
      the soil ecology group under my PhD supervisor as a bioinformatician, analyzing the
      metratranscriptomics data that was generated in the research group.
      
    • PostDoc position at the Archaea Biology department [Archaea_UniVie](https://twitter.com/Archaea_Vienna/) between April-2017 to January-2019. I mainly worked with archaeal genomics in particular, the Asgard archaea.   

#### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

     Target enrichment strategy for genes in microbial communities
        • Developed a method to target functional genes of interest in metagenomic samples. 
        • Established a pipeline to generate oligonucleotide probes to target genes from communities.
        • Validated the method in lab using DNA from soil samples to target enzymatic genes.
    
     Functional diversity in agricultural soils
        • Analyzed the diversity of SOM degrading enzymes in different land-use management soils.
        • Measured activity of these enzymes through transcriptomics combined with target strategy.
        • Measured growth of bacterial and fungal communities using incorporation methods.
  
     Species diversity in agricultural soils
        • Analyzed bacterial community composition using 16S rDNA amplicon markers in soils.
        • Analyzed fungal communities using ITS (EMF) and 28S (AMF) amplicons in soils.

#### TEACHING EXPERIENCE
    • Teaching assistant in “2016 Workshop on Genomics” in Cesky Krumlov, Czech Republic.
    • Taught in bioinformatics courses such as genomics, metatranscriptomics, PERL and python.
    • Taught in ecological courses such as terrestrial ecology and basic molecular genetics.

#### SKILLS
    • Proficiency in PERL, Python, R, Matlab and SQLite. Acquired a great deal of experiences in
      variety of genomics/metagenomics and transcriptomics/metatranscriptomics tools.
    • Ample experiences with DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, sequence capture, NGS library preparation
      and isotope incorporation for microbial growth in soil.

### More Information

Coming to my real life, I very much like to play volleyball espcially beach and I love movies! I am training in a hobby volleyball team all through the year and we train once/twice per week and I train beach volleyball during the summer more intensively :)
